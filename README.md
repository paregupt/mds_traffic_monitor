## Architecture
The MTM collector (mds_traffic_monitor_*.py) pulls stats from Cisco MDS switches using NX-API. The stats are normalized and corrected before writing to InfluxDB. Finally, Grafana provides the visualization and use-cases.

- **Data source**: [Cisco MDS Switches via NXAPI)](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/mds-9000-nx-api-reference/), read-only account is enough
- **Data storage**: [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb), a time-series database
- **Visualization**: [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

## Installation
- Tested OS: CentOS 7.x. Should work on other OS also.
- Python version: Version 3 only. Should be able to work on Python 2 also with minor modification.

### DIY Installation
1. Install Telegraf
1. Install InfluxDB
1. Install Grafana
1. Download this repo in zip format or via git clone.

## Configuration

Enable NX-API on MDS swithces via ```feature nxapi``` command.
Enter the access details of the MDS switch in mds_group*.txt file. Refer to the file for more details on input format.

Try 
```shell
$ python3 /usr/local/telegraf/mds_traffic_monitor*.py -h
```

Add to your telegraf.conf file as below

```
[[inputs.exec]]
   interval = "30s"
   commands = [
       "python3 /usr/local/telegraf/mds_traffic_monitor_high_frequency.py /usr/local/telegraf/mds_group_1.txt influxdb-lp -vv",
   ]
   timeout = "28s"
   data_format = "influx"
```

Create a different mds_group_*.txt file for every MDS switch. Repeat the above seven lines in telegraf.conf as many times as the number of monitored MDS switches. The name of the mds_group*.txt file can be changes to help you remember the switch.

Also update the global values like

```shell
  logfile = "/var/log/telegraf/telegraf.log"
  logfile_rotation_max_size = "10MB"
  logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5
```

Import the Grafana dashboard json files. That is all. Enjoy!

I haven't written detailed installation instructions yet. Nor do I have an OVA. If you are new to Grafana, InfluxDB and Telegraf, follow the steps from the UTM installation - [Cisco UCS monitoring using Grafana, InfluxDB, Telegraf â€“ UTM Installation](https://www.since2k7.com/blog/2020/02/29/cisco-ucs-monitoring-using-grafana-influxdb-telegraf-utm-installation/). The MTM project follows the same design as the UTM project. Most of the steps are the same. Make sure to replace ucs_traffic_monitor.py by mds_traffic_monitor_*.py and ucs_domains_group_1.txt by mds_group_1.txt.
